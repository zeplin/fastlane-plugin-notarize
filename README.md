# fastlane notarize plugin [![fastlane Plugin Badge](https://rawcdn.githack.com/fastlane/fastlane/master/fastlane/assets/plugin-badge.svg)](https://rubygems.org/gems/fastlane-plugin-notarize)

[fastlane](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane) plugin to [notarize](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/notarizing_your_app_before_distribution) a macOS app. 🛂

Notarize plugin provides a `notarize` action to upload an app to Apple's notarization service, querying the result periodically until it's complete—which currently takes around 2 minutes. In case of success, it staples the app with the notarization ticket. In case of failure, it prints the log file listing all the issues.

## Getting started

To get started, add it to your project:

```bash
fastlane add_plugin notarize
```

Update your `Fastfile` to use the `notarize` action:
```ruby
notarize(
    package: app_path, # Path to package to notarize, e.g. .app bundle or disk image
    bundle_id: bundle_id # Not required for .app bundles, bundle identifier to uniquely identify the package.
)
```

This action should prompt you for an Apple ID and password, using fastlane's built-in credentials manager. To use the action in a CI environment like Travis CI, CircleCI or Bitrise, you can set `FASTLANE_USER` and `FASTLANE_PASSWORD` environment variables. (Make sure to use secret environment variables, specifically for the password.)

## Example

Check out the [example `Fastfile`](fastlane/Fastfile) to see how to use this plugin. Try it by cloning the repo, running `bundle exec fastlane test`.

## Testing

To run both the tests and code style validation, run:

```bash
rake
```

To automatically fix many of the styling issues, use:
```bash
rubocop -a
```
